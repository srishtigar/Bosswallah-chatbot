## To-Do List

- [x] Phase 1: Read and analyze the assignment requirements
- [x] Phase 2: Plan the project structure and implementation approach
  - [x] Define the data 
  format and expected fields.
  - [x] Outline the RAG-based chatbot architecture.
    - [x] Data Loading and Preprocessing
    - [x] Embedding Generation
    - [x] Vector Store
    - [x] Retrieval
    - [x] Language Model (LLM) Integration
    - [x] Language Handling
  - [x] Choose appropriate libraries and models.
    - [x] Data Loading: pandas
    - [x] Text Embedding: sentence-transformers (e.g., 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
    - [x] Vector Store: FAISS (for efficient similarity search)
    - [x] Language Model (LLM): Hugging Face Transformers (e.g., a small, open-source model like 'distilbert-base-uncased') or OpenAI API (if user provides key)
    - [x] Chatbot Framework: Custom implementation using the above components
  - [x] Design the project directory structure.
    - [x] Create `src/` for main application code (e.g., `app.py`)
    - [x] Create `data/` for the dataset (e.g., `courses.csv`)
    - [x] Create `docs/` for screenshots and `README.md`
    - [x] Create `requirements.txt`
- [x] Phase 3: Implement the Python code with comprehensive comments
- [ ] Phase 4: Test and validate the implementation
- [ ] Phase 5: Package the project into a zip file and deliver to user
